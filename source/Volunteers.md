## ðŸ“š Contribute to Our Documentation!

**Why is documentation important?**
- Documentation helps us keep a clear, detailed record of our work and processes.
- It empowers students to learn and improve their understanding of how the SDC and SOC operate.

**How can you help?**
- Take initiative! Help us write and improve documentation to support our organization and your peers.
- Our GitHub Organization ([cpp-soc](https://wiki.cppsoc.xyz/)) is public and open for contributions via pull requests.

**Getting Started:**
1. **Fork or create a new branch** from `main` or `master`.
2. **Create or edit a Markdown file** in  
   ```
   documentation/source/
   ```
3. **For new pages:**  
   - Update  
     ```
     documentation/source/index.md
     ```
     so your page appears in the sidebar!
4. **Adding images:**  
   - If you can't add images directly to RTD Source, you can host them at [cppsoc.xyz](https://cppsoc.xyz).
